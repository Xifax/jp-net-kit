jp-net-kit
==========

Placeholder for collection of utilities, dedictated for consuming JDict, MeCab, Wordnet and other jp2en-translation-oriented services (even thouse without official API).

---

Rough TODOism:

1. MeCab API consumer (simplest one, actually provides API) [done];
2. JDict (requires some html parsing, partial implementation for jp2en should be enough) [done];
3. Kradfile-u (also very simple and quite useful) [done];
4. Wordnet (autocomplete, glossary, related terms);
5. Weblio (examples with jp2en translation) [somewhat done]
6. Kotobank?

---

Possible dependencies:

1. Requests [yes]
2. Kata2hira [yes]
3. BeautifulSoup [yes]
4. MessagePack?
