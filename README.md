jp-net-kit
==========

Placeholder for collection of utilities, dedictated for consuming JDict, MeCab, Wordnet and other jp2en-translation-oriented services (even thouse without official API).

---

Rough TODOism:

1. MeCab API consumer (simplest one, actually provides API);
2. JDict (requires some html parsing, partial implementation for jp2en should be enough);
3. Kradfile-u (also very simple and quite useful);
4. Wordnik (autocomplete, glossary, related terms);
5. Weblio (examples with jp2en translation)
6. Kotobank?

---

Possible dependencies:

1. Requests
2. Kata2hira
3. MessagePack?
